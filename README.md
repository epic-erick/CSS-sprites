# CSS-sprites
Example of sprites (one mega image containing multiple graphics which can be manipulated using CSS), 
  Sprites slow download time by using only one http request.
  This example covers: 
    1) Background-image
    2) Background-repeat
    3) Background-position

All css is within style tag of index.html since this is just an example
